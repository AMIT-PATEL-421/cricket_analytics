 # In Cricket, Indian Premier League (IPL) is
popular and top most revenue generating league and due to fact that itâ€™s viewership is increasing expo-
nentially over the seasons, it has attracted the betting market. Bettors and bookies has incentives on
each match bet and dynamic progression of this game ball by ball make felt the need of the machine
learning to analyze the massive data so far generated in dynamic sense. This paper investigates ma-
chine learning approach used to counter with the problem of prediction cricket match results based on
past/historical data.
Various filter-based methods, including correlation-based feature selection and Information Gain,
were used to collect features for the dataset. Predictive models were generated using machine learning
algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour, and model trees. The models
were generated from distinct feature sets generated using filter methods. Two special featured subsets
were generated for the two opponents, and analysis was performed based on the Home-Away criterion
of the match. The impact of the toss was also investigated. The results showed that Random Forest
performed better than probabilistic and statistical models in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall
metrics. The study provides valuable insights for the development of predictive models for T20 cricket
matches.
Machine learning algorithms were applied to both Home-Away team feature sets. Random Forest
outperformed other models in terms of accuracy, precision and recall metrics. The experimental results
showed the effectiveness of tree-based models. Probabilistic and statistical models were less effective.
